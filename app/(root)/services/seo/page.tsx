            Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the
            quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page
            from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as natural or
            organic results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid
            traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including
            image search, video search, academic search, news search, and
            industry-specific vertical search engines. As an Internet marketing
            strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the
            computer-programmed algorithms that dictate search engine behavior,
            what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed
            into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their
            targeted audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive
            more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher on the
            search engine results page (SERP). These visitors can then be
            converted into customers.
